# workout-tracker

## The main focus of this project is to create a fitness tracker that requires you to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express.

The first step taken was to create the server file, on this file I added the routes used in the routes folder. After creating the server, I created a table for the workout using the file on the public folder. On the apiRoutes created the get, post, and put. The most helpful tools for portion was to use the activites for the week. Then I installed the npm package and once the packages were installed I worked on framework for a server, as we learned in class earlier in the week. Reviewing the past activities was really helpful with this homework assignment.
